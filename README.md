# 2DOF-Platform
Educational experiments with a platform that can be actuated in 2 axis.

This is a common setup composed of 2 standard servos and aluminium brackets. The 1st servo turns the platform in the yaw direction (around the z-axis). The 2nd servo is mounted on top of the 1st servo's horn and changes the pitch of the platform (rotates around the x-axis). The servos are actuated by an Arduino Uno using the Servo.h library.
